            <h3>Code Review</h3>

            <p>
                We know how hard is to get your idea rolling when you are not familiar with the technology. If you are
                one of those brave developers who wish to create their
                own product and do not know if your code is taking the most out of Yii, we offer <strong>code
                review</strong> services.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our developers spent quite a lot of time in researching, studying, and they get their hands dirty with
                code on a daily basis. We will do a comprehensive look at
                your application's code, avoiding bugs and security issues, making sure your application is built
                correctly.
            </p>
